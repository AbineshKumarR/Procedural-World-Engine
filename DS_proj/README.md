# Procedural Terrain-Based Zombie Survival Game with Advanced Spatial Data Structures

## 🎮 Project Overview

This project implements a high-performance, procedurally-generated 2D zombie survival game built with React and vanilla JavaScript. The core innovation lies in the integration of **four distinct spatial data structures** (Spatial Hash Grid, Quadtree, KD-Tree, and Bounding Volume Hierarchy) to optimize real-time collision detection and spatial queries in an infinite, dynamically-generated world.

The game serves as a practical demonstration of how different spatial indexing algorithms perform under varying entity distributions (uniform, clustered, line, and mixed patterns), providing empirical evidence for data structure selection in real-time game development scenarios.

## 🔧 Detailed Technical Implementation

### Terrain Generation

The terrain generation uses **multi-layered fractal noise** with the following layers:

#### 1. Height Map

- Uses `fractalNoise2D()` with 5 octaves
- Combines multiple frequencies to create natural elevation
- Scale: 0.015 (larger features)
- Lacunarity: 2.1 (frequency increase between octaves)
- Gain: 0.45 (amplitude decrease between octaves)
- Height weight multiplier: 1.2

#### 2. Moisture Map

- Scaled by 1.3x compared to height for variation
- Used to determine lush vs arid biomes
- Affects tree placement on grass tiles

#### 3. Temperature Map

- Scaled by 0.8x for broader climate zones
- Influences biome selection (autumn vs temperate forests)

#### 4. Ridge Noise

- Additional noise layer for mountain formation
- Creates realistic mountain ridges and valleys

#### Biome Determination Algorithm

The terrain types are determined by height thresholds (after multiplying by `heightWeight`):

```javascript
if (height < 0.12) {
  // Ocean biomes
  if (height < 0.06) return DEEP_OCEAN;
  if (height < 0.09) return OCEAN;
  return SHALLOW_WATER;
} else if (height < 0.16) {
  return BEACH;
} else if (height < 0.65) {
  // Land biomes
  if (moisture > 0.7) return FOREST; // High moisture = forests
  if (moisture < 0.3) return DIRT; // Low moisture = arid
  return GRASS; // Normal moisture = grasslands
} else if (height < 0.82) {
  // Hills/mountains
  if (ridge > 0.6) return MOUNTAIN;
  return temperature > 0.6 ? DIRT : GRASS;
} else {
  // High elevation
  if (height > 0.88) return SNOW_PEAK;
  return MOUNTAIN;
}
```

#### Feature Generation

Additional features (roads, buildings, ruins) are placed using a strategic noise layer:

- Roads spawn where feature noise is 0.65-0.67 in specific height/moisture ranges
- Buildings spawn where feature noise > 0.75 at certain elevations
- Buildings become ruins in cooler climates

#### Chunk Generation Process

1. **Worker Pool**: Parallel workers generate chunks in background threads
2. **Biome Calculation**: For each tile in chunk, calculate all noise layers
3. **Tile Assignment**: Determine tile type based on biome rules
4. **Decoration**: Place trees, buildings, etc. based on tile type
5. **Collision Data**: Store tree positions in `collisionMap` with world coordinates
6. **Canvas Rendering**: Pre-render chunk to canvas for fast drawing

---

### Collision Detection System

#### Tree-Only Collision

Movement is blocked **ONLY by trees** spawned on the map. Terrain tiles (water, mountains, etc.) do not block movement - only dynamic tree objects.

#### Collision Detection Algorithm

```javascript
checkCollision(x, y, radius) {
  // 1. Get chunk coordinates
  const chunkX = Math.floor(x / (chunkSize * tileSize));
  const chunkY = Math.floor(y / (chunkSize * tileSize));

  // 2. Check 3x3 grid of chunks around position
  for (offsetX = -1 to 1) {
    for (offsetY = -1 to 1) {
      const chunkKey = `${chunkX + offsetX},${chunkY + offsetY}`;

      // 3. Get trees from collisionMap
      if (collisionMap.has(chunkKey)) {
        for each tree in collisionMap.get(chunkKey) {
          // 4. Calculate distance from player to tree center
          distance = sqrt((tree.x - x)² + (tree.y - y)²)

          // 5. Check if distance < (player_radius + tree_radius)
          if (distance < player.r + tree.collisionRadius) {
            return {collided: true, obstacle: tree, ...}
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return {collided: false}
}
```

#### Spatial Indexing for Collision

The `collisionMap` is a `Map<string, Array<Object>>` where:

- **Key**: Chunk identifier (e.g., "0,0")
- **Value**: Array of tree objects with:
  - `x, y`: World coordinates
  - `type`: "tree"
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `collisionRadius`: Bounding radius for collision

This structure allows:

- **Efficient queries**: Only check nearby chunks (3x3 grid)
- **Chunk-based loading**: Trees unload when chunk unloads
- **Scalability**: Each chunk stores its own trees

---

### Spatial Data Structures

The project implements **four spatial data structures** to compare performance:

#### 1. Spatial Hash Grid

**How it works:**

- Divides world into uniform grid cells (default 128x128 pixels)
- Each entity is inserted into all cells its bounding box overlaps
- Query searches all cells in the query range

**Implementation:**

```javascript
class SpatialHashGrid {
  constructor(cellSize = 128) {
    this.cellSize = cellSize;
    this.cells = new Map();        // cellKey → Set<entityId>
    this.entityToKeys = new Map();  // entityId → [cellKeys]
  }

  insert(entity) {
    // Calculate which cells entity occupies
    const minCx = Math.floor((entity.x - entity.r) / this.cellSize);
    const maxCx = Math.floor((entity.x + entity.r) / this.cellSize);
    // ... same for y

    // Insert entity ID into all overlapping cells
    for each cell cx, cy {
      const key = `${cx},${cy}`;
      if (!this.cells.has(key)) this.cells.set(key, new Set());
      this.cells.get(key).add(entity.id);
    }
  }

  queryRange(range) {
    const candidates = new Set();
    // Get cells in query range
    for each cell in range {
      const cellEntities = this.cells.get(key);
      if (cellEntities) {
        cellEntities.forEach(id => candidates.add(id));
      }
    }
    return Array.from(candidates);
  }
}
```

**What's stored:**

- Grid cells with entity IDs
- Reverse mapping from entities to their cells
- Used for collision detection, neighbor queries

**Performance:**

- Insert: O(1) average
- Query: O(k) where k = entities in queried cells
- Best for: Uniform entity distributions

#### 2. Quadtree

**How it works:**

- Recursively divides space into 4 quadrants (NW, NE, SW, SE)
- Splits nodes when they exceed capacity
- Query traverses tree checking which quadrants overlap query range

**Implementation:**

```javascript
class Quadtree {
  constructor(bounds, capacity = 8, maxDepth = 6) {
    this.bounds = bounds;  // {minX, minY, maxX, maxY}
    this.capacity = capacity;
    this.maxDepth = maxDepth;
    this.entities = [];
    this.divided = false;
    this.northWest = null;  // Child nodes
    this.northEast = null;
    this.southWest = null;
    this.southEast = null;
  }

  insert(entity) {
    if (!this.contains(entity)) return false;

    if (!this.divided && this.entities.length < this.capacity) {
      this.entities.push(entity);
      return true;
    }

    if (!this.divided) this.subdivide();

    // Try inserting into child quadrants
    return this.northWest.insert(entity) ||
           this.northEast.insert(entity) ||
           this.southWest.insert(entity) ||
           this.southEast.insert(entity);
  }

  queryRange(range, found = []) {
    if (!this.intersects(range)) return found;

    if (!this.divided) {
      // Check all entities in this leaf node
      for each entity in this.entities {
        if (range.contains(entity)) found.push(entity);
      }
    } else {
      // Query child quadrants
      this.northWest.queryRange(range, found);
      this.northEast.queryRange(range, found);
      this.southWest.queryRange(range, found);
      this.southEast.queryRange(range, found);
    }
    return found;
  }
}
```

**What's stored:**

- Tree nodes with entity arrays
- Bounding boxes for each quadrant
- Hierarchical subdivision adapts to entity density
- Used for collision detection, range queries

**Performance:**

- Insert: O(log n) average
- Query: O(log n + k) where k = results
- Best for: Clustered entity distributions

#### 3. KD-Tree

**How it works:**

- Binary tree with alternating axis splits (x then y)
- Sorts entities by coordinate, selects median as pivot
- Query traverses tree checking axis-aligned boundaries

**Implementation:**

```javascript
class KDTree {
  constructor(entities, depth = 0) {
    const axis = depth % 2; // 0 = x, 1 = y
    const sorted = entities.sort((a, b) => a[axis] - b[axis]);
    const median = Math.floor(sorted.length / 2);

    this.node = sorted[median];
    this.axis = axis;
    this.left = depth < this.maxDepth ? new KDTree(sorted.slice(0, median), depth + 1) : null;
    this.right = depth < this.maxDepth ? new KDTree(sorted.slice(median + 1), depth + 1) : null;
  }

  queryRange(range, found = []) {
    const axis = this.axis;

    // Check if node is in range
    if (range.contains(this.node)) found.push(this.node);

    // Check if range intersects axis line
    if (this.left && range.min[axis] <= this.node[axis]) {
      this.left.queryRange(range, found);
    }
    if (this.right && range.max[axis] >= this.node[axis]) {
      this.right.queryRange(range, found);
    }

    return found;
  }
}
```

**What's stored:**

- Binary tree with median-split entities
- Alternating axis splits for balanced search
- Used for nearest neighbor queries, AI pathfinding

**Performance:**

- Build: O(n log² n)
- Query: O(log n + k)
- Best for: Balanced queries without prior knowledge

#### 4. Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)

**How it works:**

- Hierarchical tree of bounding boxes
- Each parent's bounding box encompasses all children
- Query early-terminates when bounding boxes don't intersect

**Implementation:**

```javascript
class BVH {
  constructor(entities) {
    this.root = this.buildTree(entities);
  }

  buildTree(entities) {
    if (entities.length <= this.capacity) {
      // Leaf node
      return {
        bounds: this.computeBounds(entities),
        entities: entities,
        isLeaf: true
      };
    }

    // Internal node - recursive subdivision
    const [left, right] = this.splitEntities(entities);
    return {
      bounds: this.computeBounds(entities),
      left: this.buildTree(left),
      right: this.buildTree(right),
      isLeaf: false
    };
  }

  queryRange(range, node = this.root, found = []) {
    if (!this.intersects(range, node.bounds)) return found;

    if (node.isLeaf) {
      // Check all entities in leaf
      for each entity in node.entities {
        if (range.contains(entity)) found.push(entity);
      }
    } else {
      // Query children
      this.queryRange(range, node.left, found);
      this.queryRange(range, node.right, found);
    }
    return found;
  }
}
```

**What's stored:**

- Hierarchical bounding boxes
- Parent-child relationships
- Used for complex hierarchies, rigid bodies

**Performance:**

- Build: O(n log n)
- Query: O(log n + k)
- Best for: Hierarchical structures with parent-child relationships

   - Stored in: `collisionMap` (world-wide), spatial index (for entity queries)
   - Used for: Collision detection, obstacle avoidance

2. **Zombies**: Enemy entities

   - Stored in: `entities Map` (EntityPool), spatial index
   - Used for: AI pathfinding, attack detection

3. **Projectiles**: Bullets fired by player

   - Stored in: `entities Map`, spatial index
   - Used for: Hit detection against zombies

### Entity Lifecycle

#### Creation (Entity Pool)

```javascript
const entity = entityPool.acquire();
entity.x = spawnX;
entity.y = spawnY;
entity.type = 'zombie';
entity.active = true;
// Entity is automatically added to spatial index
```

#### Update Loop

```javascript
for each entity in entityPool.allActive() {
  entity.x += entity.vx * dt;
  entity.y += entity.vy * dt;

  // Spatial index is updated every N frames
  if (frameCount % rebuildInterval === 0) {
    spatialIndex.rebuild(allEntities);
  }
}
```

#### Deletion

```javascript
entity.active = false;
entityPool.release(entity);
// Removed from spatial index on next rebuild
```

## 📊 Benchmarking System

The game includes a comprehensive benchmarking system to compare data structure performance:

### Test Scenarios

1. **Uniform Distribution (100, 1000, 4000 entities)**

   - Entities randomly distributed across entire world
   - Tests scalability with entity count

2. **Clustered Distribution (500 entities)**

   - Entities grouped in 5-8 tight clusters
   - Tests adaptive subdivision performance

3. **Line Distribution (300 entities)**

   - Entities arranged in 3-5 long thin lines
   - Tests worst-case scenarios

4. **Mixed Distribution (800 entities)**
   - 60% clustered, 40% sparse uniform
   - Tests real-world usage patterns

### Metrics Collected

- **FPS**: Average, minimum, maximum during test
- **Query Time**: Time spent in spatial queries per frame
- **Candidate Count**: Number of entities returned per query
- **Memory Usage**: Active entities, loaded chunks
- **Insertion Time**: Time to rebuild spatial index

### Running Benchmarks

```javascript
// Run a single benchmark
await simulationController.runExperiment({
  name: 'Uniform 1000',
  entityCount: 1000,

### Biome Generation Logic

```javascript
// Height determines base terrain type
height < 0.12 → Ocean (deep, normal, shallow)
height < 0.16 → Beach

// Moisture determines land biome
if (height < 0.65) {
  moisture > 0.7 → Forest (with trees)
  moisture < 0.3 → Dirt
  else → Grass (with occasional trees)
}

// Elevation determines mountains
if (height < 0.82) {
  ridge > 0.6 → Mountain
}
if (height > 0.88) {
  return SNOW_PEAK
}
```

## 🔬 Debug Visualization

When debug mode is enabled (Press D), you can see:

1. **Red Dashed Circle**: Collision query range around player
2. **Yellow Circles**: Detected obstacles (trees)
3. **Green Lines**: Connection lines from player to obstacles
4. **White Text**: Distance labels showing distance to each obstacle
5. **Data Structure Label**: Shows which DS is handling queries
6. **Object Count**: Number of nearby objects detected

This visualization demonstrates that:

- The spatial data structure is actively querying for objects
- Only trees are detected (not terrain)
- Distances are calculated in real-time
- The DS successfully reduces O(n²) to O(k) where k << n

## 📊 Automatic Collision Logging

Every second, the game logs nearby objects detected by the current data structure:

```
📍 COLLISION QUERY (GRID):
   Player at (-133.8, 163.8)
   Query radius: 112.0 units
   Found 3 objects nearby
   1. tree
      Position: (-120.0, 175.0)
      Distance: 25.4 units
      ID: 0,0_tree_3_5
      Collision Radius: 10.5
```

This demonstrates:

- Which data structure is processing queries
- How many objects are detected
- Exact positions and distances
- Real-time collision detection in action

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Game Loop (Fixed Timestep)

```
Start → Initialize Systems
    ↓
Load Initial Chunks → Spawn Player
    ↓
Main Loop (60 FPS) {
    Read Input (WASD, Mouse)
    Calculate Movement
    Query Spatial Index for Collision
    Apply Movement
    Update Entities
    Process AI
    Handle Entity Collisions
    Update Spatial Index
    Render World
    Log Collisions (every 60 frames)
}
    ↓
Game Over → Cleanup
```

### Collision Detection Pipeline

```
Player Movement Request
    ↓
Calculate New Position (x', y')
    ↓
Query Spatial Index: QueryRange(x'-r, y'-r, x'+r, y'+r)
    ↓
    ├─→ Grid: Get cells, collect entities
    ├─→ Quadtree: Traverse tree
    ├─→ KD-Tree: Traverse with axis splits
    └─→ BVH: Check bounding box overlap
         ↓
Filter to Trees Only
    ↓
For Each Tree {
    Calculate Distance
    Check: distance < (playerRadius + treeRadius)?
    If Yes: Log Collision
}
    ↓
Allow Movement (Visualization Mode)
```

## 📊 Chunk Management

### Chunk Lifecycle

1. **Generation**: Created when player enters chunk radius
2. **Decoration**: Trees added to `collisionMap[chunkKey]`
3. **Loading**: Canvas cached for fast rendering
4. **Unloading**: Cleared when player moves far enough

### Chunk Storage

```javascript
chunks = Map {
  "0,0": {
    cx: 0, cy: 0,
    tiles: Uint8Array[256],  // 16x16 = 256 tiles
    biomeData: {height, moisture, temperature},
    canvas: HTMLCanvasElement,
    collisionMap: [
      {x: 16, y: 16, type: 'tree', id: '0,0_tree_0_0'},
      {x: 48, y: 16, type: 'tree', id: '0,0_tree_2_0'},
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```
